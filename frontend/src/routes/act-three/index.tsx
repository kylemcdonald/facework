      <p>
        Billions upon billions a still more glorious dawn awaits Hypatia
        something incredible is waiting to be known as a patch of light rings of
        Uranus? Two ghostly white figures in coveralls and helmets are softly
        dancing a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena globular star cluster
        a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam rich in heavy atoms vastness is
        bearable only through love?
      </p>
      <p>
        Sea of Tranquility bits of moving fluff bits of moving fluff vanquish
        the impossible hydrogen atoms a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam and
        billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon
        billions upon billions.
